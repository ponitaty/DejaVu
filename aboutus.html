    <h1>Deja Vu</h1>
    <h2>A Collection of Your Past</h2>
    <p>Deja Vu is a website that acts like a time capsule. It allows you to store photographs of your fond memories in a
    safe that you can access with a passcode. You can write descriptions of the images, creating your own
    hobby-photography portfolio for themselves, friends, and family with access code to your work. </p>
